												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>May the odds be ever in your favour!</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>SASE</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>----- Round Details ----- Round 1: What&rsquo;s This? One person from each team goes up and make an item given with clay, you and your teammate have 60 seconds to make and guess. After 60 seconds if your team is not able to make the right guess, other teams are open to guess. 10 points for a right guess.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Round 2: Got Knowledge Every team is given a white board. We will have 13 problems shown on the screen. You have 30 seconds to write down the answers. Each problem is worth around 10 points.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Round 3: Mastermind We will play a fun and easy &ldquo;number guessing&rdquo; game. The rule will be explained that day. The top seeds play the lower seeds from the first two rounds. The winners get 10 points, if it&rsquo;s tie, each team gets 5 points, and losing teams get no point.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Final Round! The top three teams from the first three rounds will be participating our &ldquo;300 Dollars Drop&rdquo;!!! There are 7 multiple questions with four options. You will also be given 2 lifelines (one 50/50 and one &quot;ask the audience&quot;) The top team goes first with $300 CASH, you put the money on the options you think are most possible. For example: Where is University of Washington? A. Seattle B. Pullman C. Alaska D. China You can put all $300 on A for this question. If you are not sure about the answer, you can put $240 on A, $30 on B, and $30 on C for example. The money you put on the wrong answers will be taken by an evil man in black&#8230; You proceed with whatever is left to the next question. At the end, you get to walk away with how ever much cash you have left!! And after the highest score team finish, the second highest score team goes next with whatever left from the $300 (if the highest-scored team win $50, second team starts with $250). And then third team.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Tie Breaker: if two teams with the same score (matters for the final round), we will play one more number guessing game to break the tie.</p>
												<p>&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Please come and enjoy the fun questions and the exciting games. It will be super fun!!! The final round will be like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSVnOg9yC3c</p>
